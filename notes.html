                        <li>galen picks the conjurer, leads to the sunsword, a great blade. Living entity, bound by fate to those that weild it. Dead village, drowned by a river, ruled by one who has brought great evil into this world.</li>
                        <li>monk - tome of straud, relic of power and darkness, window into tormented soul of author, and the curse that binds him to barovia, hidden beneath the sun, in the house of a saint</li>
                        <li>the seer - destined to find an ally who will help us greatly, find a dusk elf that is living among the vistani, suffered great loss and needs help, help him, and he will help us</li>

                        <li>the druid - a holy symbol, forged in an ancient light long forgotten, a beacon of hope, symbol of resistance, understood by few, coveted by many, a tree, ancient and evil, growing atop the Graves where the dead sleep, the ravens can help me find it.</li>

                    </p>
                    <p>Ireena - only future she cant see, sees the devils mark on her, woe clings to her, a vampire covers beauty and so took does he hate it, Flee or become the devils bride, trust only those who truly know you.

                    </p>
                    <p>Stay for an hour, head on. Find an old stone bridge 1000 feet above us. Blue raven falls in front of us, injured, a bunch of strix behind it chasing.
                    </p>
                    <p>We fight.
                    </p>
                    <p>Heal raven. Take 5 silver Barbs out of raven. It heals. It's a were-raven. Blue tipped wings. Agreed to help.
                    </p>
                    <p>Traveling with us. Dont see anything else in the valley. Watchtower on the side of the road as we move. Go up and see a bit of the map. Keep moving. Across the bridge that was above us before.
                    </p>
                    <p>Bridge - guard in middle, gargoyles on either side.
